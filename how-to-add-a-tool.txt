There are several places in this repo you will need to modify to add a new tool
to this flavor of kali

*** kali-config/common/hooks/normal/osint-packages.chroot ***

Think of this file as the "install script" for all the additional tools.
This will contain the instructions to get our tools installed. 
Follow the examples in the file. 
Normally: pull down git repo, install dependencies, move our helper script, make helper executable

*** kali-config/common/includes.chroot/usr/share/applications/ ****

This folder contains the information for menu icons.
Follow the examples and add one for your new tool. 
Essentially, these icons just kick off a helper script stored in /usr/bin


*** kali-config/common/includes.chroot/usr/bin/ ***

This folder contains the helper scripts that kick off our tools.
You'll need to create one for the tool you are installing. 
Follow the examples but essentially it's one line that runs your tool
Note: All of these helper scripts will get moved to /usr/bin/ during the install process above
